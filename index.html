<p>Most home user not aware of their daily electricity consumption until they receive their monthly bill. They usually not sure when to control their usage behavior and what is expected result from their action. It is hard to save energy when user do not have the data they need whenever they want it. Hence that electricity consumption monitoring system is required to solve this problem. Smart Electricity Consumption Monitoring System for Smart Home will monitor whole home electricity usage which can cover all devices especially devices that do not have plugs such as lighting circuits and other direct wired devices.</p>

<a id="problemstatement" class="anchor" href="#problemstatement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem statement</h3>

<p>There are four general problems in existing electricity meter reading system which is:</p>
  i.	a lack of real time awareness electricity consumption record to the user.<br>
  ii.	a lack of access to the meter reading anywhere and anytime.<br>
  iii.	a lack of electricity usage data history record to the user.<br>
  iv.	inability to plan and control electricity usage behavior to save energy and money.
<p>
  Smart Meters usually used in Smart Grid system to send information of daily electric usage directly to energy supplier. Smart Meters can accurately monitor electricity usage remotely without the need to provide meter readings. The fallback of this approach is that, the existing meter reading will need to be replace with Smart Meters and required approval from energy supplier.</p>
<p>
  Another approach is by using Energy Monitor. This tools able to extend the function of existing meter reading. Energy monitor will make user aware of their energy usage. It is a great tools to change their behavior and cut electricity bills. There is a plug-in energy monitor which is used between a socket and the device being measured. The disadvantage of this approach is that when there is so many home appliance, user will need this plug-in energy monitor for each individual devices.<br>
  Smart Electricity Consumption Monitoring System for Smart Home will monitor whole home electricity usage which can cover all devices especially devices that do not have plugs such as lighting circuits and other direct wired devices.</p>

<a id="aimobjective" class="anchor" href="#aimobjective" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aim and objectives</h3>

<p><p>The objectives of this project is to develop effective Smart Electricity Consumption Monitoring System for Smart Home. This include researching on suitable metering devices, controller, integration approach and developing application system for the controller and a mobile application. User can access their electricity consumption anytime and anywhere from the mobile application. The application system in the controller will record the data from the meter and analyze the electricity usage behavior. The mobile application can notify the user when their electricity consumption is exceed their personalized goal. This indirectly educate user and promote energy saving and help reduce their monthly bills.</p></p>
